Introduction
The project is mainly about helping the user to plan for their lesson to boost productivity. This helps the planner to save time and schedule their time well and avoid deadlines and being in trouble in case of exam. As my favorite quote goes him who fails to plan is planning to fail so this helps the user not to fail. If itâ€™s a teacher the cause their textbook to plan for their classes and get to know what they will be teaching in classes.

Flow Description
The first step is whereby the user input their location or a location they require, here you will be prompted to input the city name cause that is the get functionality of the api were are using this will prevent the user from getting errors
Next step is where by it gets a response which we got the action from the weather.py file this will give us the response from the API about the weather of that location (city) that the user had input
________________________________________
Custom Action
Description
My action is to get the weather information of a certain area thus helping which is an action from the main file this will give a response based on that
Code
def extract_text_from_pdf(file):
    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
    num_pages = len(pdf_reader.pages)
    text = ""
    for page_num in range(num_pages):
        page = pdf_reader.pages[page_num]
        text += page.extract_text()
    return text

The logic for this action is to extract data from the pdf file that has been uploaded by the user and giving out the text to be used to plan and schedule your lesson
Integration
The flow of the project contains different flows that depend on each other. The action for the first code is to upload a file this helps the user when he or she wants to upload a file.

User Interface
UI Design
The design of my user interface is the y using the gradio default template.
The submit button submits whatever the user input in the text area 
The clear button erases every information from the text area and output area thus
The flag button acts as our save button which saves whatever the app has displayed on the output area for future references for the user
 
Gradio Implementation
I used Gradio to create the interface by creating buttons and areas to input text and out text required by the user 

import gradio as gr

# Initialize NLTK components
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
ps = PorterStemmer()

# Function to preprocess text
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Tokenize text into sentences and words
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    words = word_tokenize(text)

    # Remove stop words and punctuation, and perform stemming
    cleaned_words = [ps.stem(w.lower()) for w in words if w.isalnum() and w.lower() not in stop_words]

    return cleaned_words

# Async function to extract text from PDF file
async def extract_text_from_pdf(file):
    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)

How to Use
To run the project follow the step by step instructions to run it
Step 1: Start the Application
1.	Run the application using the command provide above ensure itâ€™s in your terminal
2.	You can use the ctrl+click to open the url or follow the statement below 
3.	Open your web browser and navigate to the local host URL (usually http://localhost:7861/).
4.	 
Step 2: Interact with the UI
1.	Upload the pdf that you want it to be Click the submit button to run the flow or just click the enter button.
2.	View the output results in the output area 
3.	 
Step 3: Understanding the Output
1.	The output above is injsonformat that contains the lessonpplanwhich divides into sections the main part which contains the keyconcepts ,the unitsor subtopics and many nmore. 

Use Cases
My project can be used by a user who wants to get the planandschedule their study classes therefore helping them to study everything

Demo Video
This is the link for my demo video of my app in action
https://youtu.be/KpxtI8JlI4g________________________________________
Conclusion
My project is based on the userâ€™s ability to upload a pdf and use it to schedule and plan their day.
I got to understand how to integrate the gradio user interface and how to use asyncflows in my project.
________________________________________
Future Work
I plan to add the llama language model to help in planning the work easier and help analyze and summarize the work easier 
I also plan to add a feature whereby you not  only upload a pdf but also a txt file that will help the user in future to plan their work more easily________________________________________
